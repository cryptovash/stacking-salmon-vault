### Stacking Salmon Vault

This repository contains the vault contracts of the Stacking Salmon Protocol. Protocol users can deposit LP tokens in Stacking Salmon Vaults and receive Vault Tokens. The deposited LP tokens are then farmed and earned rewards are automatically converted to additional LP tokens and reinvested.

Stacking Salmon Vault Tokens are fully compatible with the Stacking Salmon Core Contracts. As such, they can be used as collateral in Stacking Salmon lending pools, along with their underlying token pairs.
